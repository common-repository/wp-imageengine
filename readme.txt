RETIRED PLUGIN. WP ImageEngine is an intelligent image CDN for optimizing, compressing, resizing and delivering images according to the screen- or viewport size.

== Description ==

THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. AS WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THE PLUGIN WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON FUTURE VERSION OF WORDPRESS, WE RECOMMEND OUR USERS TO SIGN UP FOR A [COMMERCIAL VERSION OF IMAGEENGINE](https://imageengine.io?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) OR FOLLOW THIS GUIDE ON [HOW TO ENABLE IMAGEENGINE WITHOUT A PLUGIN](https://www.scientiamobile.com/easy-wordpress-image-optimization-without-plugins/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine).

WP ImageEngine is an intelligent image CDN for optimizing, compressing and resizing images.
ImageEngine will enhance your responsive images by enabling support for HTTP2, automatic webp conversion, Client Hints and more.

It is likely that ImageEngine will shave off 50-60% of data traffic generated by images on your site. To better support mobile devices, ImageEngine relies on WURFL for server side device detection in cases where responsive images and Client Hints fall short.

The plugin will automatically optimize the images you include in your posts and pages. For images baked into your theme, there is a php API available (See FAQ).

[Registration](https://scientiamobile.com/imageengine/signup?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine#imageengine-lite) is required to get your unique application token. Without this token, the plugin will not be activated.


= Responsive Images Support =

WP ImageEngine is compatible with the changed `<img>` tag introduced in Wordpress 4.4, while still providing full support for older versions. For Wordpress version 4.4 and above the plugin will optimize every version of the image referenced in `srcset`.  ImageEngine will prefix your image `srcset` and `src` (URI) with your personal hostname which refer to the image optimization servers.

= Client Hints = 

The plugin will enable Client Hint support for your site. Client Hints, with information about the viewport size, device pixel ratio and actual image size, are added to the image request (HTTP header) enabling ImageEngine to resize the image with surgical precision.

= HTTP2 support =  

HTTP will give additional performance improvement on the network level. WP ImageEngine supports HTTP2 over SSL, which means that if you serve your sites and images by `https://`, ImageEngine will automatically serve all images over HTTP2.

= WebP =

WebP is a lightweigh image format with great quality. WebP is well supported by browsers. ImageEngine will detect if the end user's browser supports WebP and automatically convert any format to WebP to increase performance.

= Try it out =

For detailed information go [here](https://www.scientiamobile.com/page/imageengine-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine). On this page you'll also find a [demo tool](https://www.scientiamobile.com/page/imageengine-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) where you can enter the URL of your site, and see the potential savings with ImageEngine.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to register to use ImageEngine? =

Yes, you can sign up for an account [here](https://scientiamobile.com/imageengine/signup?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine). When you register for a trial we'll contact you and issue a unique application token.

= Where do I get my ImageEngine token to make the Plugin work? =

You must register and [create an account for ImageEngine at ScientiaMobile](https://scientiamobile.com/imageengine/signup?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine#imageengine-lite).  Our team will reach out to you and provide you with a free trial account and a unique token.  When you get the token, go to the plugin admin pge and paste it into the WordPress ImageEngine Settings on the "Your Token" line. See [Screenshots section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-imageengine/screenshots/) for more.
Please note that if you activate the plugin without - or with an invalid - token, you images will get watermarked.

= Can I test the current performance of my images somewhere? =

Yes, you can go [here](https://www.scientiamobile.com/page/imageengine-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=page&utm_term=wp-imageengine&utm_campaign=wp-imageengine) and enter the URL to your page.

= Do the plugin support all themes? =

Your theme has to support html5 (most themes does today). If you install the plugin and can't get responsive images to work properly, try adding `add_theme_support('html5');` to your `functions.php` file.

= Is the plugin compatible with other plugins? =

If you have other plugins altering the URLs of images or plugins for other CDNs you might want to do a test before launching. We constantly monitor this, but if you stumble upon a case of incompability, please submit a ticket. Note that if you use plugins that caches the markup or plugins enabling CDNs, you might need to purge the cache or disable the plugins fully if you want to turn on or off ImageEngine.

= Can I use it in my theme or plugin ? =

Yes. Use this function: `<?php wpie_get_converted_url( $url_to_convert, $options );?>`

* `$url_to_convert` is the full url, including http(s)://, to the image.
* `$options` is an array of configuration options. If not set, values from plugin admin page will be used. The array looks like this `array("key"=>"xyz","key_type"=>"normal","w"=>0,"h"=>0,"pc"=>0,"fit"=>"")`

= Is ImageEngine a CDN? =

Yes. ImageEngine runs on several locations, including Amazon. However, ImageEngine can also play together with your existing CDN if you want to keep it. Either in front of- or behind your existing CDN.

= Does ImageEngine make changes to my images? =

Yes. In order to optimize the image we need to make changes in size, croping, aspect ratio and compression. You accept that we can do this by using ImageEngine. However, you still own your images, including the derivates, during their lifetime in cache

= Can I see how much data ImageEngine is saving? =

Yes, by logging into your account.

= What are “Client Hints”? =

Client Hints is an emerging standard, spear-headed by Google, which enables the browser to append information about how an image should be displayed, such as size and device pixel ratio. ImageEngine uses this information if it is available. With the addition of WURFL data, ImageEngine has all information needed to produce an optimal result based on how and where a specific image is displayed.

= Which PHP version? =

PHP >= 5

= I have relative URLS. Is it supported? =

Yes, both urls relative to protocol, `//` and urls relative to the host name, `/wp-content/upload...` are supported.

== Screenshots ==
1. This is the lite version and all possible settings. In this example plugin functionality is deactivated.
2. This is the pro version and all possible settings . In this example plugin-functionality is activated.
3. Shows performance improvement before and after activation of WP-ImageEngine.
4. When logged onto your ScientiaMobile account, find your ImageEngine Application token.
5. Copy and paste the Application token into the text field on the plugin settings page, and save.
